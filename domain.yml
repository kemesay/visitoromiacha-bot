            It was 887 square kilometers in area out of which 482 square kilometers is covered by water of
            Lake Abijata and Shala. This park used to have about 31 species of mammals such as Spotted
            Hyena, Golden and Black Backed Jackals, Olive Baboon, Grant's Gazelle, etc., and 367 species of
            birds. Before, myriad of local and exotic birds that come from Europe and different parts of the
            world used to congregate here in at Lake Abijata. July to September being the peak season of
            congregation (and best time to watch birds) in the year. Hundreds of thousands of Flamingoes
            and Great White Pelicans, Fish Eagles, King Fishers, the tall Marabou Stork, Cormorants and
            Darters, etc. used to roam here in Lake Abijata and in the side-by lake Shala. There were also
            vast colonies of sacred Ibis, Queela, Stilt, Snope Black Heron, Avocet, Egyptian Geese, Egrets,
            Plovers, etc. It is quite unlikely however, to see most of the birds mentioned above while some
            species are seen in small number (seasonally), due to the same reason stated earlier. Located
            at 215 kilometers from Finfinnee the small enclosure of Ostrich farm hosts a group of ostriches
            with some Grant's Gazelles. At the park's head quarter one can easily observe (watch) a flock of
            male and female ostriches and some gazelles. Lake Shala, which is separated to the south from
            lake Abijata by a strip of land has a delightful view for its deep blue color with excellent
            reflections of the magnificent western hills.
            At the north eastern shore of the lake Shala, one can be impressed by a tumbling cascade of hot
            springs and smoke of vapor that rush out down to the bay. This is typical investment potential
            for spa resort development and some investors are being attracted by this intact nature. The
            other fascinating part of the lake is the Gike Site. It is situated on the lofty land at the south
            western shore of Lake Shala. This is the best site for bird watching and camping. It is accessible
            by a sturdy car through Aware and Sanbate towns found south of Shashamane. Lake Shala is
            also the ideal lake for water transportation to make touring around the tiny islands and for
            connecting its western and eastern shore. South west of Lake Shala, there is also a small
            alkaline Crater Lake known as Lake Chitu. This small lake, more than any other lake, is the best

              It was here in Mada Walabu where rules and regulations were reformed through traditional

              place by pilgrims from all over Oromo Gada Governance to pray for wish fulfillment such as
              favor, protection, health happiness etc. It was a place where power transfer took place
              peacefully from the Gada leader in power to the new one. So it was considered as a sacred
              place with peace where there was no killing, theft and lies telling. Currently Oromia Regional

              kilometers far from Robe along the all weather road that passes through Jarra, and Dallo Sabro
              towns. Travel to Dirre Sheika Husen can be made directly from Sof Umar via Ginir and Jara town
              or back to Robe and follow the line described earlier. The Shrine is named after an ancient
              Muslim holy man (religious leader) called Sheikh Nur Husein bin Malka or bin Ibrahim who was
              reputed for his religious teachings, high devotion and remarkable miraculous deeds. According
              to oral history, the birth of Sheikh Nur Husein, or 'Sheikhana Husein' is dated back to 12th
              century in the same site now called Anajina
              Local elders say that he was born 942 years ago from his father Malka or Sheik Ibrahim and his
              mother Shamsiyya. According to legend Sheikh Husein had passed 250 years alive on earth out
              of which he spent 50 years in a place called Sakina (in Arsi) or in a state of disappearance into
              spiritual life or devotion, 130 years in various parts of the world and 70 years at his Dirre itself.

              practiced at the 'Anajina' are Islamic from the view point of the Shari'ah and the Islamic
              Monotheisin. However, there are two annual celebration occasions at the Dire. The days are
              counted according to the Islamic calendar Hijirah. Thus one of the occasions is known as 'Hajji'.
              It is in the month 'Zul-Hijjah'. The peak days of this celebration are the 9th and the 10th Zul-
              Hijjah, or the worldwide Islamic holiday 'Arafah'. The other occasion, which is known as 'Zahra'
              is in the month 'Jimadul-Thani' of the same calendar, the peak celebration days being the 14th
              and the 15th. In both occasions visitors can arrive at the Dirre in the afternoon of the first day to
              enjoy the evening /the night celebration which is the beginning of the celebration of the second
