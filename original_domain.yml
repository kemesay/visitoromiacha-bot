  utter_abajifar:
  - text: Aba Jifar Palace is the most important heritage site in the Oromia Region of Ethiopia, and a symbol of Oromia cultural identity. Located on the outskirts of the city of Jimma, the capital of the region, the current Palace was built by King Aba Jifar II in the 1880s on a site located seven kilometers north of Jimma and chosen by the King's father.
  utter_bale_mountains:
  - text: " Bale Mountains National Park is in Oromia Region National State, 400 kilometers southeast of Addis Ababa and 150 kilometers east of Shashamene. Five woredas make up the BMNP boundary. These are Adaba or west, Dinsho or north, Goba or northeast, Delo-Mena-Angetu, and Harena-Buluk (southeast).The Bale Mountains are part of the Bale-Arsi massif which runs through the western part of Ethiopia's Highlands.The mountains have been glaciated at least twice throughout their history, and they were glaciated as recently as 2,000 years ago. There are certain geological features that remain an enigma to geologists and glaciologists such as the striations that appear on shallow hillsides on the Sanetti Plateau. By attracting enormous volumes of orographic rainfall,the Bale Mountains play an important role in climate regulation in the region, Over 12 million people from Kenya, Somalia, and Ethiopia rely on water from the Bale massif. Temperatures vary wide the park is divided into five distinct and unique habitats."

  - text: "Sof Omar Caves is Ethiopia's longest cave, measuring 15.1 kilometers or 9.4 miles in length. It was the longest cave in Africa when it was examined in 1972. The Weyib River (Gestro River) flows through it, and it is located east of Robe in the Bale Zone of the Oromia Region in southeastern Ethiopia.It dives at the  Ayiew Maco entrance and resurfaces 1 kilometer (0.62 mi) distant at the Holuca resurgence. Sof Omar was the name of a Muslim holy man who resided in the area. Local names for 'name' and cave, respectively, are Maco and Holuca. It has always been a religious center, revered to both Islam and the Oromo traditional religion. The caves, particularly the Chamber of Columns, are noted for their numerous pillars. n 1894, the explorer Arthur Donaldson Smith documented his expedition to the cave. In 1913, an Italian expedition also paid a visit. Henri Breuil undertook archaeological research in the area in 1934. The cave was almost certainly explored by Italians. "
  utter_sheikh_hussein:
  - text: "The town is named after what some Ethiopian Muslims consider to be the country's most hallowed site the grave of Sheikh Hussein, a thirteenth-century Somali saint from Merca who preached Islam to the Sidamo people living in the area at the time. He is also credited with building and founding the Sultanate of Bale, as well as performing other miracles. A number of these miracles were documented in Rabi' al-Qulub, a hagiography published in Cairo in the 1920s. Despite the fact that this town is now within the Oromo homelands, it continues to be the destination of around 50,000 Muslim Ethiopian pilgrims twice a year during the Muslim months of Hajj and Rabi' al-Awwal. The first pilgrimage commemorates his birth, while the second commemorates his death. They traditionally carry Oulle Sheikh Hussein cleft sticks, which are too little to function as walking sticks and aren't used for anything else. When the visitors arrive at the shrine, they take turns crawling through a narrow entryway to enter the saint's tomb. The village and the neighboring Kachamsare valley are part of a large religious complex dedicated to the saint. Emir 'Abd al-Shakur ibn Yusuf of Harar built a shrine to the Baghdadi saint 'Abd al-Qadir al-Jilani near Sheikh Hussein's tomb inside the shrine enclosure in the 18th century. As part of the project, a cemetery has been dedicated. Other notable features of the compound include the Dinkiro pond, built in dry stone masonry 300 meters south of the mosque, and a spring with miraculous water. "
